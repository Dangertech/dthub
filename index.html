			Right now, this website is not in a state where I'd call it done (although it looks really
			sexy already). My teacher <gl>didn't announce a deadline yet</gl>, so I'll just fumble around
			a bit for now. I have some things I want to implement until the time runs out:
			<ul class="center">
				<li>
					Add a <gl class="special">GitHub "Rich Presence"</gl> section.
					<br>
					I have no idea how to do this tbh, but I want a section that shows stuff like <gl>my
					most recent commit, when and on which project it was</gl> and stuff like that, and
					of course I want it to update automatically. I know of the 
					<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest" target="_blank">GitHub REST API</a>, but
					I don't even know what REST means and if it is <gl>even possible to make HTTP GET requests
					on Website load</gl> (but I'm optimistic with that, JavaScript was made exactly for things
					like that after all). Another thing to consider is the authenticity: GitHub probably
					doesn't want random websites bombarding their servers with requests, so the 
					idea might fail because of this. I'll see soon, I guess.
				</li>
				<li>
					<gl class="special">Split up the website into multiple links</gl>
					The website is growing, and I need to get some structure in there. Having separate
					pages would make it easier to manage and view it but downgrade the "<i>overall experience</i>"
					(the SYNTHETIK SUN, the gradient, etc...).
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					A <gl class="special">random line of text</gl> below the logo that changes upon reloading the page. 
					A JavaScript script will run through a file with quotes and pick a random one. 
					<gl>✓ This is done!</gl>
				</li>
				<li>
					An 
					<a href="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.FsEwZ4GxtqHzo-UoC6QkzQHaEo%26pid%3DApi&f=1"
					   target="_blank">
						epic synthwave sun
					</a> 
					at the bottom of the page, shining up with a linear gradient. Man, I love that artstyle.
					<gl>✓ This is done and it looks <i>really</i> cool. Reload the page and scroll down to see how it rises!</gl>
				</li>
				<li>
					Make the <gl class="special">SYNTHETIK SUN swoosh</gl> a bit up and down after it has risen. This is due 2021-1-19;
					<gl>✓ This is done! *<i>swoosh</i>* "Haha!" *<i>swooooosh</i>*</gl>

					I wrote this because of my Raspberry Pi. You see, the Pi is supposed to
					act as a server to my data, constantly running scripts to synchronize 
					itself with the internet (for example, I currently let it synchronize my
					OneDrive account every 3600 seconds). When I let it run for a few days without
					supervision I need to be able to understand what and when happened when I
					come back and notice that it doesn't work anymore. So, more specifically,
					I needed <gl>something to write data to a file</gl> and it seemed as there
					was <gl>no good software</gl> that did this yet, so I wrote it myself.

		I have some ideas for future projects that I might take on one day.
		They range from quick easy program to entire videogames.
			<ul class="center">
				<li>
					<gl class="special">Hackerman</gl>
					<br>
					Wanna look cool in front of everyone without having to resolve
					to websites like <a href="https://hackertyper.net" target="_blank">
						hackertyper</a>
					and doing it all from the comfort and speed of your terminal?
					Hackerman wants to do all this. I imagine a system that lets you
					define a file to show the text from and properties like if you
					have to type to advance the text or if it scrolls automatically,
					the appearance and more through arguments, and then run it through
					<gl>ncurses</gl>.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<gl class="special">LIFELINE - A week is a lifetime</gl>
					<br>
					A macabre diary application, displaying how much of your life you
					have already used up, how long you still have left to live,
					and a chart showing every week in your life you already lived,
					inspired by 
					<a href="https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/products/lifespan-calendar-poster?variant=39451596455984" target="_blank">
						kurzgesagt</a>.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<gl class="special">A vocabulary trainer</gl>
					<br>
					This would really come in handy sometime. The tool would be
					a terminal application, again in ncurses. The data should
					be saved using the ankidroid format or another existing
					flash cards file format.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<gl class="special">A Voxel game in which you build a society from scratch </gl>
					<br>
					The Idea is very rough, but it is supposed to be a 
					city builder/simulation which takes on progressively larger scale.
					You start in a dead universe, as a 3d character, on a large floating
					rock once called earth. You are an <em>immortal being with otherwise
					human powers</em> that lives since the 21st Century, now finally
					pulling itself up to <gl>rebuild the universe</gl>. You start by building small
					machines enabling you to do basic things like terraforming a few voxels
					at a time, creating energy and food. Then you <gl>clone your first human </gl>and
					create a society. You <em>can</em> then switch into a top-down view of your
					planet, terraform at larger scale and manage multiple buildings at once.
					Then you develop <gl>spacefaring</gl>, extending to other planets, eventually
					<gl>conquering entire galaxies</gl>. You complete the game by building an artifact
					that can <gl>create another universe</gl>, 
					and create a new savefile. 
					<br>
					Pretty ambitious, I know. I would want to create an own engine for this game
					to enable a high-performance simulation of possibly complex societies and machinery,
					all set in a voxel world where you can modify every single one of the infinite
					amount of voxels in an infinite universe.

		So my family has gifted me a 
		<a href="https://raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</a> for Christmas
		and they are slowly realizing that this was a horrible idea and they are slowly
		<gl>stripped of their privacy</gl> and confidence that no cameras are installed in this household.
		(<i>I'm just joking of course, right? Right!?</i>)
		<br>
		I am working on software and scripts, published and unpublished, that are aiming
		to make it an information collection center that runs routine tasks, like <gl>backing up</gl>, making
		my data more accessible to me and <gl>gathering useful intel</gl> on stuff on the internet and my surroundings.
		</p>
		<ul class="center">
			<li>
				<gl class="special">A simple log tracking the status of the pi 
				and the devices I connect to it</gl>
				<br>
				This is a must have. Important data should be saved to a file on the pi,
				like which temperature it has, when it got disconnected from the internet
				<span title="'For real, when our heating system doesn't work anymore, I'll blame it on that thing, no matter if it really is it's fault or not!'">
					(my father fears this thing, so this might be very useful),
				</span>
				or maybe even if it crashes, but I don't know if I can get 
				<a href="http://smarden.org/runit/" target="_blank">runit</a>
				to do something if it fails. Also, I want to log my SSH accesses but I don't
				see the ssh log under /var/log/auth.log?
				<br>
				<gl>I have already written the backend for this,</gl> <a href="#userlog">userlog</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<gl class="special">A Taskserver</gl>
				<br>
				I am using <a href="https://taskwarrior.org" target="_blank">Taskwarrior</a>, a really cool
				and featureful CLI to-do list. They also have this project called 
				<a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/why.html" target="_blank">Taskserver</a>
				which lets you, as the name suggests, set up a tool on a server that 
				synchronizes all your tasks across all your devices. I currently do this
				through OneDrive by just having my task folder in my OneDrive directory
				that I sync regularly with the amazing 
				<a href="https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive" target="_blank">OneDrive CLI tool by abraunegg</a>,
				but having a synchronization via my very own server sounds way cooler.
			</li>
			<li>
				<gl class="special">A camera system with face detection</gl>
				<br>
				I've always wanted to play around with 
				<a href="https://opencv.org" target="_blank">OpenCV</a>. I'd simply 
				connect a webcam to the pi and let a program run that collects the webcam
				data, saves an image every 3 seconds or so and tries to get interesting data
				out of it (how bright is it, are there faces/movement on the image, etc).
				I don't know if it's a smart idea to pull that off with C++ as well, maybe
				I'd have to use Python for that, but I like the idea to try and decode
				the camera data through C++ by myself.

		My current setup starts working autonomously as soon as I give power to it.
		I've set up a static IP address for my Ethernet connection which can be accessed
		about 5 seconds after powering on, thanks to the fabulous <gl>runit</gl> init scheme.
		However, the <gl>WiFi doesn't want to work</gl> for some reason which makes me dependent
		on having the Pi next to our router, where my father can reach out and easily switch it
		off because he's creeped out by it. I need to find a solution and make the Pi
		Ethernet-independent but I get an uneasy feeling that the WiFi chip might be broken...
		<br>
		On startup, runit executes whatever is in <gl>/etc/rc.local</gl> as root, which I use
		to start some scripts that run as background processes, performing their job in an 
		infinite loop until they are killed, normally only by shutdown<span class="blinking">|</span>

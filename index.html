			AY! Almighty one, you stumbled upon this shitty website!
			<br> 
			Here, in a million years, a great hub shall be created. A hub,
			giving great innovation to a futuristic society, empowering people
			all over the world to do whatever they want.

			<h2>What is supposed to happen</h2>

			<br>
			Right now, you can see the only page on this website, black on white, awful to look at
			and worse to use. Yeah, that's the 1990's style you were looking for. So we need something
			to make'er pretty, right? <b>Until 2022</b>, I want the basics of <b>CSS</b> and 
			maybe even <b>JavaScript</b> to be seared into my brain, and then, you can witness, well,
			at least a decent website. I find the minimal, ASCII-art infused style of the 
			<a href="https://adventofcode.com">AdventOfCode</a> website to be very appealing, so
			I think I'll try to imitate that a little bit. (How do you make fuggin bloom? I don't
			think I'll manage to include that)

			But right now, you are only linked to my lame GitHub projects.
			<br>
			For example:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://github.com/Dangertech/tictactoe-ncurses">
						tictactoe-ncurses
					</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://github.com/Dangertech/lesson-controller">
						lesson-controller
					</a>
					<br>
					(Not yet Available to the public)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://github.com/Dangertech/shitty-aoc-2021">
						Shitty AdventOfCode 2021
					</a>
					<br>
					(Available, but I take no responsibility)
				</li>
				<li>
					When it has reached a better state, I also want the code
					for this website to be available on GitHub. If I can,
					I'll try to make this a <i>professional</i> homepage
					(but without these embarassing portraits people usually have on their About-pages)

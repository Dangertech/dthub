			This website is a task for my CS class. I don't have any prior experience in Web Development
			and actually never wanted to delve into it. You're just writing stuff, and making it look
			fancy and don't actually produce tools that can help in any way. But I'm still putting
			some time into this because a web presence could certainly be useful. It's mostly just
			ads for myself, stuff about me and what I do.

		This is the <gl>dead simple</gl> start of my github "rich presence" feature. The endgoal
		is to have a little info box here that shows my latest commit in <i>any</i> of my repos
		and how long ago it were. I need <gl>Authentication</gl> for that (with my account, to get my
		private repos) and I yet have to figure out how to do that without presenting my password
		to you, dear visitor, on a silver tablet.

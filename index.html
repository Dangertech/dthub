			This website is a task for my CS class. I don't have any prior experience in Web Development
			and actually never wanted to delve into it. You're just writing stuff, and making it look
			fancy and don't actually produce tools that can help in any way. But I'm still putting
			some time into this because a web presence could certainly be useful. It's mostly just
			ads for myself, stuff about me and what I do.

					A <gl>random line of text</gl> below the logo that changes upon reloading the page.

		I have some ideas for future projects that I might take on one day.
		They range from quick easy program to entire videogames.
			<ul class="center">
				<li>
					<gl>Hackerman</gl>
					<br>
					Wanna look cool in front of everyone without having to resolve
					to websites like <a href="https://hackertyper.net" target=_blank">
						hackertyper</a>
					and doing it all from the comfort and speed of your terminal?
					Hackerman wants to do all this. I imagine a system that lets you
					define a file to show the text from and properties like if you
					have to type to advance the text or if it scrolls automatically,
					the appearance and more through arguments, and then run it through
					<gl>ncurses</gl>.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<gl>LIFELINE - A week is a lifetime</gl>
					<br>
					A macabre diary application, displaying how much of your life you
					have already used up, how long you still have left to live,
					and a chart showing every week in your life you already lived,
					inspired by 
					<a href="https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/products/lifespan-calendar-poster?variant=39451596455984" target=_blank">
						kurzgesagt</a>.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<gl>A vocabulary trainer</gl>
					<br>
					This would really come in handy sometime. The tool would be
					a terminal application, again in ncurses. The data should
					be saved using the ankidroid format or another existing
					flash cards file format.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<gl>A Voxel game in which you build a society from scratch </gl>
					<br>
					The Idea is very rough, but it is supposed to be a 
					city builder/simulation which takes on progressively larger scale.
					You start in a dead universe, as a 3d character, on a large floating
					rock once called earth. You are an <em>immortal being with otherwise
					human powers</em> that lives since the 21st Century, now finally
					pulling itself up to rebuild the universe. You start by building small
					machines enabling you to do basic things like terraforming a few voxels
					at a time, creating energy and food. Then you clone your first human and
					create a society. You <em>can</em> then switch into a top-down view of your
					planet, terraform at larger scale and manage multiple buildings at once.
					Then you develop spacefaring, extending to other planets, eventually
					conquering entire galaxies. You complete the game by building an artifact
					that can create another universe, 
					and create a new savefile.

		I've gotten a <a href="https://raspberrypi.org" target=_blank">Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</a> recently and am
		currently collecting ideas on what to do with it. I want to use it as a server
		and have it running 24/7, so it will probably complete data collection and web
		scraping tasks. My ideas are pretty rough at the moment.
		</p>
		<ul class="center">
			<li>
				<gl>A simple log tracking the status of the pi 
				and the devices I connect to it</gl>
				<br>
				This is a must have. Important data should be saved to a file on the pi,
				like which temperature it has, when it got disconnected from the internet
				<span title="'For real, when our heating system doesn't work anymore, I'll blame it on that thing, no matter if it really is it's fault or not!'">
					(my father fears this thing, so this might be very useful),
				</span>
				or maybe even if it crashes, but I don't know if I can get 
				<a href="http://smarden.org/runit/" target="_blank">runit</a>
				to do something if it fails. Also, I want to log my SSH accesses but I don't
				see the ssh log under /var/log/auth.log?
			</li>
			<li>
				<gl>A Taskserver</gl>
				<br>
				I am using <a href="https://taskwarrior.org" target=_blank">Taskwarrior</a>, a really cool
				and featureful CLI to-do list. They also have this project called 
				<a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/why.html" target=_blank">Taskserver</a>
				which lets you, as the name suggests, set up a tool on a server that 
				synchronizes all your tasks across all your devices. I currently do this
				through OneDrive by just having my task folder in my OneDrive directory
				that I sync regularly with the amazing 
				<a href="https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive" target=_blank">OneDrive CLI tool by abraunegg</a>,
				but having a synchronization via my very own server sounds way cooler.
			</li>
			<li>
				<gl>A camera system with face detection</gl>
				<br>
				I've always wanted to play around with 
				<a href="https://opencv.org" target=_blank">OpenCV</a>. I'd simply 
				connect a webcam to the pi and let a program run that collects the webcam
				data, saves an image every 3 seconds or so and tries to get interesting data
				out of it (how bright is it, are there faces/movement on the image, etc).
				I don't know if it's a smart idea to pull that off with C++ as well, maybe
				I'd have to use Python for that, but I like the idea to try and decode
				the camera data through C++ by myself.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="center">
		I want the pi to be able to start all it's tasks autonomously, so I don't have
		to plug in a monitor and keyboard and start them manually every time it boots.
		This way, I have a little box that I just have to supply with power to start it.
		I still have to configure a static IP address for the wi-fi chip though. I'm
		still dependent on the Ethernet connector, which IP address I know. The processes
		could be started in <gl>/etc/rc.local</gl>, 
		which gets executed on boot<span class="blinking">|</span>

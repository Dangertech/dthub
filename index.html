			My newest tool, vainglorious is now available on my github
			profile! Vainglorious is a richly featured <gl>hacking simulator</gl>,
			customizable with all sorts of stuff. 
			<a href="https://github.com/Dangertech/vainglorious">Check it
			out</a> and tell me what you think! This is the last project before
			I move on to something bigger, which I want to announce in this manner
			as well.

			This website is a task for my CS class. I don't have any prior experience in Web Development
			and actually never wanted to delve into it. You're just writing stuff, and making it look
			fancy and don't actually produce tools that can help in any way. But I'm still putting
			some time into this because a web presence could certainly be useful. It's mostly just
			ads for myself, stuff about me and what I do.

		This is the <gl>dead simple</gl> start of my github "rich presence" feature. The endgoal
		is to have a little info box here that shows my latest commit in <i>any</i> of my repos
		and how long ago it were. I need <gl>Authentication</gl> for that (with my account, to get my
		private repos) and I yet have to figure out how to do that without presenting my password
		to you, dear visitor, on a silver tablet.

			Also, I know that there's a bug with the <gl>SYNTHETIK SUN</gl>
			not displaying correctly at the bottom of the page. It's very
			annoying and not really fixable, but I have an idea for a workaround.

			AY! Almighty one, you stumbled upon this shitty website!
			<br> 
			Here, in a million years, a great hub shall be created. A hub,
			giving great innovation to a futuristic society, empowering people
			all over the world to do whatever they want.

			Right now, you can see the only page on this website, black on white, awful to look at
			and worse to use. Yeah, that's the 1990's style you were looking for. So we need something
			to make'er pretty, right? <gl>Until 2022</gl>, I want the basics of <gl>CSS</gl> and 
			maybe even <gl>JavaScript</gl> to be seared into my brain, and then, you can witness, well,
			at least a decent website. I find the minimal, ASCII-art infused style of the 
			<a href="https://adventofcode.com">AdventOfCode</a> website to be very appealing, so
			I think I'll try to imitate that a little bit. (<s>How do you make fuggin bloom? I don't
			think I'll manage to include that</s> I have bloom already!)

				<li>
					<a href="https://github.com/Dangertech/tictactoe-ncurses" target=_blank">
						tictactoe-ncurses
					</a>
					<br>
					An overengineered tic-tac-toe game written in C++ 
					utilizing the ncurses library
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<a href="https://github.com/Dangertech/lesson-controller" target="_blank">
						lesson-controller
					</a>
					<br>
					Software to manage static timetables, like in school. Intended
					to be easily parsable by scripts to let ones computer react
					dynamically to the current lesson. I myself want to use it for
					assigning my homework the right lesson tag and due dates automatically
					<br>
					(Not yet Available to the public, but already in a really good shape)
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<a href="https://github.com/Dangertech/shitty-aoc-2021" target=_blank">
						Shitty AdventOfCode 2021
					</a>
					<br>
					(Available, but I take no responsibility)
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					When it has reached a better state, I also want the <gl>code
					for this website</gl> to be available on GitHub. If I can,
					I'll try to make this a <i>professional</i> homepage
					(but without these embarassing portraits people usually have on their About-pages)

		<h2 class="center hover"><gl>$</gl> dthub --list-ideas</h2>

		I have some ideas for future projects that I might take on one day.
		They range from quick easy program to entire videogames.
			<ul class="center">
				<li>
					<gl>Hackerman</gl>
					<br>
					Wanna look cool in front of everyone without having to resolve
					to websites like <a href="https://hackertyper.net" target=_blank">
						hackertyper</a>
					and doing it all from the comfort and speed of your terminal?
					Hackerman wants to do all this. I imagine a system that lets you
					define a file to show the text from and properties like if you
					have to type to advance the text or if it scrolls automatically,
					the appearance and more through arguments, and then run it through
					<gl>ncurses</gl>.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<gl>LIFELINE - A week is a lifetime</gl>
					<br>
					A macabre diary application, displaying how much of your life you
					have already used up, how long you still have left to live,
					and a chart showing every week in your life you already lived,
					inspired by 
					<a href="https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/products/lifespan-calendar-poster?variant=39451596455984" target=_blank">
						kurzgesagt</a>.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<gl>A vocabulary trainer</gl>
					<br>
					This would really come in handy sometime. The tool would be
					a terminal application, again in ncurses. The data should
					be saved using the ankidroid format or another existing
					flash cards file format.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<gl>A Voxel game in which you build a society from scratch </gl>
					<br>
					The Idea is very rough, but it is supposed to be a 
					city builder/simulation which takes on progressively larger scale.
					You start in a dead universe, as a 3d character, on a large floating
					rock once called earth. You are an <em>immortal being with otherwise
					human powers</em> that lives since the 21st Century, now finally
					pulling itself up to rebuild the universe. You start by building small
					machines enabling you to do basic things like terraforming a few voxels
					at a time, creating energy and food. Then you clone your first human and
					create a society. You <em>can</em> then switch into a top-down view of your
					planet, terraform at larger scale and manage multiple buildings at once.
					Then you develop spacefaring, extending to other planets, eventually
					conquering entire galaxies. You complete the game by building an artifact
					that can create another universe, 
					and create a new savefile.<span class="blinking">|</span>

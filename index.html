			This website is a task for my CS class. I don't have any prior experience in Web Development
			and actually never wanted to delve into it. You're just writing stuff, and making it look
			fancy and don't actually produce tools that can help in any way. But I'm still putting
			some time into this because a web presence could certainly be useful. It's mostly just
			ads for myself, stuff about me and what I do.

			Right now, this website is not in a state where I'd call it done (although it looks really
			sexy already). My teacher <gl>didn't announce a deadline yet</gl>, so I'll just fumble around
			a bit for now. I have some things I want to implement until the time runs out:
		</p>
			<ul class="center">
				<li>
					<gl class="special">Refactor the --list--projects and --list-ideas -c tag into one</gl>
					<br>
					Ok, so here's the plan in shitty text-form: We have <gl>three "sections": Done, Doing and To Do</gl>
					The individual entries are encased in fancy boxes and the sections are visibly connected to each
					other. The "doing" section might have an animation with some kind of <gl>inifinite progress</gl>
					bar or something, in the usual epik neon style.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add a <gl class="special">GitHub "Rich Presence"</gl> section.
					<br>
					I have no idea how to do this tbh, but I want a section that shows stuff like <gl>my
					most recent commit, when and on which project it was</gl> and stuff like that, and
					of course I want it to update automatically. I know of the 
					<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest" target="_blank">GitHub REST API</a>, but
					I don't even know what REST means and if it is <gl>even possible to make HTTP GET requests
					on Website load</gl> (but I'm optimistic with that, JavaScript was made exactly for things
					like that after all). Another thing to consider is the authenticity: GitHub probably
					doesn't want random websites bombarding their servers with requests, so the 
					idea might fail because of this. I'll see soon, I guess.
				</li>
				<li>
					<gl class="special">Split up the website into multiple links</gl>
					<br>
					The website is growing, and I need to get some structure in there. Having separate
					pages would make it easier to manage and view it but downgrade the "<i>overall experience</i>"
					(the SYNTHETIK SUN, the gradient, etc...).
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					A <gl class="special">random line of text</gl> below the logo that changes upon reloading the page. 
					A JavaScript script will run through a file with quotes and pick a random one. 
					<gl>✓ This is done!</gl>
				</li>
				<li>
					An 
					<a href="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.FsEwZ4GxtqHzo-UoC6QkzQHaEo%26pid%3DApi&f=1"
					   target="_blank">
						epic synthwave sun
					</a> 
					at the bottom of the page, shining up with a linear gradient. Man, I love that artstyle.
					<gl>✓ This is done and it looks <i>really</i> cool. Reload the page and scroll down to see how it rises!</gl>
				</li>
				<li>
					Make the <gl class="special">SYNTHETIK SUN swoosh</gl> a bit up and down after it has risen. This is due 2021-1-19;
					<gl>✓ This is done! *<i>swoosh</i>* "Haha!" *<i>swooooosh</i>*</gl>

		So my family has gifted me a 
		<a href="https://raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</a> for Christmas
		and they are slowly realizing that this was a horrible idea and they are slowly
		<gl>stripped of their privacy</gl> and confidence that no cameras are installed in this household.
		(<i>I'm just joking of course, right? Right!?</i>)
		<br>
		I am working on software and scripts, published and unpublished, that are aiming
		to make it an information collection center that runs routine tasks, like <gl>backing up</gl>, making
		my data more accessible to me and <gl>gathering useful intel</gl> on stuff on the internet and my surroundings.
		</p>
		<ul class="center">
			<li>
				<gl class="special">A simple log tracking the status of the pi 
				and the devices I connect to it</gl>
				<br>
				This is a must have. Important data should be saved to a file on the pi,
				like which temperature it has, when it got disconnected from the internet
				<span title="'For real, when our heating system doesn't work anymore, I'll blame it on that thing, no matter if it really is it's fault or not!'">
					(my father fears this thing, so this might be very useful),
				</span>
				or maybe even if it crashes, but I don't know if I can get 
				<a href="http://smarden.org/runit/" target="_blank">runit</a>
				to do something if it fails. Also, I want to log my SSH accesses but I don't
				see the ssh log under /var/log/auth.log?
				<br>
				<gl>I have already written the backend for this,</gl> <a href="#userlog">userlog</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<gl class="special">A Taskserver</gl>
				<br>
				I am using <a href="https://taskwarrior.org" target="_blank">Taskwarrior</a>, a really cool
				and featureful CLI to-do list. They also have this project called 
				<a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/why.html" target="_blank">Taskserver</a>
				which lets you, as the name suggests, set up a tool on a server that 
				synchronizes all your tasks across all your devices. I currently do this
				through OneDrive by just having my task folder in my OneDrive directory
				that I sync regularly with the amazing 
				<a href="https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive" target="_blank">OneDrive CLI tool by abraunegg</a>,
				but having a synchronization via my very own server sounds way cooler.
			</li>
			<li>
				<gl class="special">A camera system with face detection</gl>
				<br>
				I've always wanted to play around with 
				<a href="https://opencv.org" target="_blank">OpenCV</a>. I'd simply 
				connect a webcam to the pi and let a program run that collects the webcam
				data, saves an image every 3 seconds or so and tries to get interesting data
				out of it (how bright is it, are there faces/movement on the image, etc).
				I don't know if it's a smart idea to pull that off with C++ as well, maybe
				I'd have to use Python for that, but I like the idea to try and decode
				the camera data through C++ by myself.

		My current setup starts working autonomously as soon as I give power to it.
		I've set up a static IP address for my Ethernet connection which can be accessed
		about 5 seconds after powering on, thanks to the fabulous <gl>runit</gl> init scheme.
		However, the <gl>WiFi doesn't want to work</gl> for some reason which makes me dependent
		on having the Pi next to our router, where my father can reach out and easily switch it
		off because he's creeped out by it. I need to find a solution and make the Pi
		Ethernet-independent but I get an uneasy feeling that the WiFi chip might be broken...
		<br>
		On startup, runit executes whatever is in <gl>/etc/rc.local</gl> as root, which I use
		to start some scripts that run as background processes, performing their job in an 
		infinite loop until they are killed, normally only by shutdown<span class="blinking">|</span>

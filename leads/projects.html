				An overengineered tic-tac-toe game written in C++ utilizing the ncurses library

				This right here was <gl>my first <i>real</i> larger-scale program</gl> and at 
				the same time the beginning
				of my dive into the extremely robust programming language couple C/C++. It's just
				what it says - a tictactoe game for your terminal. It has quite a lot of features
				and even (a <i>really</i> shitty) <gl>computer enemy</gl>! The code quality is horseshit
				in retrospect but find it holds up really good in comparison to its competitors on
				github.

				I wrote this because of my Raspberry Pi. You see, the Pi is supposed 
				to act as a server to my data, constantly running scripts to 
				synchronize itself with the internet (for example, I currently 
				let it synchronize my OneDrive account every 3600 seconds). 
				When I let it run for a few days without supervision I need to be 
				able to understand what and when happened when I come back and 
				notice that it doesn't work anymore. So, more specifically, 
				I needed something to <gl>write data to a file</gl> and it 
				seemed as there was <gl>no good software</gl> that did this yet, so I wrote it myself.

				This is my bot for the MMO colony game <a href="https://screeps.com">Screeps</a>.
				Screeps is one of the most complex and most interesting video games I've ever encountered.
				Although the concepts and mechanics are simple, you can probably spend thousands of hours
				refining your approaches and prepare to react to every situation. You have a spawn in a vast
				world filled with other players. The basic goal is to spawn creeps (think of them as little
				robots) that harvest resources to provide to their colony and build up your own little society,
				completely managed through your own JavaScript code.
				The game has also heavy PVP elements as resources are not that plentiful so you might start
				a war with another colony (there was even a World War!) In short, its a colony "simulation"
				but you have to code the sim AI yourself.
				<br>
				My bot is not very advanced (yet) and right now only manages to occupy one room and does
				not expand. It manages creeps based on tasks that are <gl>dynamically assigned</gl> based on the
				colony needs (we need more energy -> Assign more creeps that harvest Energy; Some structure
				requires repair -> Assign creeps that repair this structure). This is a real advantage
				in contrary to the classical "role" model (one creep gets one task to execute for it's
				whole lifetime): The spawn doesn't have to constantly produce creeps that execute a task
				maybe once and then stand around idly, but instead the colony adapts quickly to changes.
				However, it is more complicated to code and makes trouble with stupid creep selection
				for tasks (Code selects a creep to pick up energy although it can't carry a lot, or a
				creep changes it's task all the time and never gets something done).
				<br>
				I'm als currently saving up some money for the <gl>CPU lifetime subscription</gl> for
				110â‚¬ so I am dedicated more time by the Screeps servers to run my code, and can
				in turn manage a wayyy bigger colony.

				`
					The Idea is very rough, but it is supposed to be a 
					city builder/simulation which takes on progressively larger scale.
					You start in a dead universe, as a 3d character, on a large floating
					rock once called earth. You are an <em>immortal being with otherwise
					human powers</em> that lives since the 21st Century, now finally
					pulling itself up to <gl>rebuild the universe</gl>. You start by building small
					machines enabling you to do basic things like terraforming a few voxels
					at a time, creating energy and food. Then you <gl>clone your first human </gl>and
					create a society. You <em>can</em> then switch into a top-down view of your
					planet, terraform at larger scale and manage multiple buildings at once.
					Then you develop <gl>spacefaring</gl>, extending to other planets, eventually
					<gl>conquering entire galaxies</gl>. You complete the game by building an artifact
					that can <gl>create another universe</gl>, 
					and create a new savefile. 
					<br>
					Pretty ambitious, I know. I would want to create an own engine for this game
					to enable a high-performance simulation of possibly complex societies and machinery,
					all set in a voxel world where you can modify every single one of the infinite
					amount of voxels in an infinite universe.

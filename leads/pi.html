		So my family has gifted me a 
		<a href="https://raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</a> for Christmas
		and they are slowly realizing that this was a horrible idea and they are slowly
		<gl>stripped of their privacy</gl> and confidence that no cameras are installed in this household.
		(<i>I'm just joking of course, right? Right!?</i>)
		<br>
		I am working on software and scripts, published and unpublished, that are aiming
		to make it an information collection center that runs routine tasks, like <gl>backing up</gl>, making
		my data more accessible to me and <gl>gathering useful intel</gl> on stuff on the internet and my surroundings.
		</p>
		<ul class="center">
			<li>
				<gl class="special">A simple log tracking the status of the pi 
				and the devices I connect to it</gl>
				<br>
				This is a must have. Important data should be saved to a file on the pi,
				like which temperature it has, when it got disconnected from the internet
				<span title="'For real, when our heating system doesn't work anymore, I'll blame it on that thing, no matter if it really is it's fault or not!'">
					(my father fears this thing, so this might be very useful),
				</span>
				or maybe even if it crashes, but I don't know if I can get 
				<a href="http://smarden.org/runit/" target="_blank">runit</a>
				to do something if it fails. Also, I want to log my SSH accesses but I don't
				see the ssh log under /var/log/auth.log?
				<br>
				<gl>I have already written the backend for this,</gl> <a href="#userlog">userlog</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<gl class="special">A Taskserver</gl>
				<br>
				I am using <a href="https://taskwarrior.org" target="_blank">Taskwarrior</a>, a really cool
				and featureful CLI to-do list. They also have this project called 
				<a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/why.html" target="_blank">Taskserver</a>
				which lets you, as the name suggests, set up a tool on a server that 
				synchronizes all your tasks across all your devices. I currently do this
				through OneDrive by just having my task folder in my OneDrive directory
				that I sync regularly with the amazing 
				<a href="https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive" target="_blank">OneDrive CLI tool by abraunegg</a>,
				but having a synchronization via my very own server sounds way cooler.
			</li>
			<li>
				<gl class="special">A camera system with face detection</gl>
				<br>
				I've always wanted to play around with 
				<a href="https://opencv.org" target="_blank">OpenCV</a>. I'd simply 
				connect a webcam to the pi and let a program run that collects the webcam
				data, saves an image every 3 seconds or so and tries to get interesting data
				out of it (how bright is it, are there faces/movement on the image, etc).
				I don't know if it's a smart idea to pull that off with C++ as well, maybe
				I'd have to use Python for that, but I like the idea to try and decode
				the camera data through C++ by myself.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="center">
		My current setup starts working autonomously as soon as I give power to it.
		I've set up a static IP address for my Ethernet connection which can be accessed
		about 5 seconds after powering on, thanks to the fabulous <gl>runit</gl> init scheme.
		However, the <gl>WiFi doesn't want to work</gl> for some reason which makes me dependent
		on having the Pi next to our router, where my father can reach out and easily switch it
		off because he's creeped out by it. I need to find a solution and make the Pi
		Ethernet-independent but I get an uneasy feeling that the WiFi chip might be broken...
		<br>
		On startup, runit executes whatever is in <gl>/etc/rc.local</gl> as root, which I use
		to start some scripts that run as background processes, performing their job in an 
		infinite loop until they are killed, normally only by shutdown<span class="blinking">|</span>
